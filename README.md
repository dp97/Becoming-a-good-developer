# How to be a good developer
Speaker: Mr. Rimi Azizi from Theta Edge Sdn Bhd

Working hour usually 9 - 5, but officially 24 hours to be honest

The reason that choose software engineer because the title is nice.

If you want to survice in SE or software development environment, you must have passion about it, because it is very stressful and require a lot of work.

Where do I start? Which programming languages? Suppose to learn algorithm rather than learn programming directly. Learning programming through "Hello, World" is not a good solution.

When we go about programming, it goes about algorithm, instructions. When we learn programming languages like java, scala and ada, the basis of what we do doesn't run from algorithm. The programmer must have strong sense of algorithm.

Go starbuck buy coffee, list all steps

Have to think about how the instructions combined to a loop, can the instructions segmented into sub-functions?

Should have changed the way to learn. Not just blindly copy and paste.

Pyramid of knowledge
Data, information, knowledge, wisdom

To print "Hello, World!" is just a simple call of a function and it doesn't give that much. You need understand the code that you write, how it works, why it works, play with it, do different experiments with it to see what's happenning etc. Suppose you used printf function once, but you have no clue how it works and use it at its full potential, then the best way to know how something works is to to look in its mechanism, to build it from scratch, and that goes to not only printf but all functions. Man is your friend, read a man every day just to know, because it will help you a lot.

you know to use printf, when you are asked to,  is knowledge
if you have enough knowledge, you know where to use it, that is wisdom

should be able to transfer data into knowledge, when don't have knowledge, don't have the wisdom to make decision, so might be hurted in the future environment.

Understand how to learn is more important, etc when cooperating with medical, build medical system

Please do not memorize the syntax, should understand the syntax, the concept behind it, syntax come with practice and practice makes perfect!

You always complaint for leacturer, but it is not about the teacher, it is about the learner
It is not about what the teacher teach, it is about what you wanted to learn

It is very good if you participate in a Hackathon. You can meet many developers and see how they work, and meet more people at your age
To know where you stand, your level etc

Try to find a company from europe, it can be easier because it is not so much workload
